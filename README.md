# AI-Calendar-Assistant
This project aimed to create an AI Assisted Calendar Schedular which helps users to schedule, update, and delete Google Calendar events using natural language. It integrates the power of Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM with Google Calendar and Gmail APIs, wrapped in a simple Flask-based chat interface.
